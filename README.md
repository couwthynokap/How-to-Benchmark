- This repository provides practical instructions and examples for benchmarking applications using PresentMon, Xperf, and CapFrameX tools.

## Objective:

- This guide will help you to test the effectiveness of game optimization guides and your tweaks by analyzing performance using PresentMon, Xperf and CapFrameX. You'll be able to measure FPS, analyze application performance bottlenecks, and see if the changes you've made actually have a positive impact on performance.

# Tools:

> PresentMon: A tool for analyzing graphics performance, providing information about FPS, rendering time, presentation time, and other metrics.
> Xperf: A powerful Windows performance profiling tool for collecting and analyzing system performance data.
> CapFrameX: A tool for capturing and analyzing frames in games to identify problems with visual effects, textures, lighting, and other aspects of graphics.

## Requirements:

- Windows 10 or 11 latest build is installed, being able to read carefully means that the operating system is running its most updated version, capable of providing a more stable and secure computer, as well as well as support for new features and enhancements. It also implies that this system is running on build 2004, which is an interim update version containing bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features originally released for Windows 10. Reading and understanding information about the installed version of the operating system is important to ensure that your computer is operating correctly and to account for the need for additional updates or maintenance.


## Usage:

> Study the instructions for using each tool in the appropriate folders.
> Use the examples to familiarize yourself with the basic functions of the tools.
